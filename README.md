Anki addon: minimize to tray with hotkey support for windows
=========================================================
Adds an icon to the system tray and allows minimizing anki to the tray when the icon is pressed or when the main window X button is pressed. Pressing hotkey toggles the minimize or maximized state. Default hotkey is Alt+F.

Platform Support
================
 Hotkeys only work on **Windows**.</br>
 The original author reports [issues](https://github.com/simgunz/anki21-addons_minimize-to-tray/issues) on windows but I dindn't found one.</br>
 This addon is primarily developed and tested on **Linux**.

Configuration
=============
- To start Anki minimized in the tray, go to *Tools > Add-ons > Minimize to tray > Config* and set `hide_on_startup` to `true`
- To enable debug mode (for troubleshooting), set `debug` to `true` in the same config menu. Debug messages will be printed to the console.
- To change hotkey, set `global_hotkey` to new hotkey in the same config menu. It is case insenstive so alt+F Alt+F or ALT+F works the same.
