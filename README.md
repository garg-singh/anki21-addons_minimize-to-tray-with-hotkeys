Anki addon: minimize to tray
=========================================================
Adds an icon to the system tray and allows minimizing anki to the tray when the icon is pressed or when the main window X button is pressed.

Platform Support
================
This addon is primarily developed and tested on **Linux**.

**Windows support is limited** due to platform-specific bugs that are often difficult to debug. Many of these issues appear to be caused by upstream problems in Qt or Anki's Windows implementation. If you encounter issues on Windows, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/simgunz/anki21-addons_minimize-to-tray/issues) for known problems and workarounds.
